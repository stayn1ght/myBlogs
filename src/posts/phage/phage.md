## prophage hunter: for active prophages
Prophages are temperate phages integrated in bacterial genomes. While some prophages are active—they can be induced by stresses like UV or antibiotics, others are defective due to bacterial defence systems or mutational decay.

Several tools have been developed to predict the existence of prophage sequences from bacterial NGS data.
